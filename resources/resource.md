# introduction

This folder contains the resources needed for the Pac-Man game, such as images, sounds and mazes. Here is a brief introduction of each subfolder:

* maze: This subfolder contains the text files that define the layout and objects of each level. Each character in the text file represents a different type of object, such as wall, pellet, power, fruit, cage, etc. The maze files are named as “level X.txt”, where X is the level number.

* graphics: This subfolder contains the image files that are used to display the game elements on the screen, such as Pac-Man, ghosts, fruits, etc. The image files are named according to their corresponding objects.

* sounds: This subfolder contains the sound files that are played during the game, such as background music, sound effects, etc. The sound files are named according to their functions.
